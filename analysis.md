Figure B

Comparing Figure A and B, we found that headpose and microexpression has a linear relationship. Due to the method data is generated(leading to a slope of 1), we can only analyze based on the Y-intercept, which is 12.34 for Figure A, 23.45 for Figure B. This indicates that MicroExpression has a heavier impact in Virtual reality than Headpose does in Hologram.  <br>
